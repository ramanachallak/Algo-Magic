# Algo-Magic
Repository for Project#2. 


## Thoughts from the first meeting - 

Build a testing application for comparing (using backtesting) various predictive models 

	- validating Facebook Prophet's predictions
	- Using google Collab to build linear regression model
	- User inputs for Ticker/Ticker list
	- Visualizations 
	- refine master functions module
	- parameters - Close/Volatility (depending on time)
	- we will be comparing FB Prophet against our model with only the closing price
	- We will be trying to use both Close and Volatility in our model to see if that gives us better predictions
	- time frequency - days
  	- X_(t)
	- X(t) - X(t-1)
	- X(t) - X(t-2)
	- Y = alpha + beta_1 * (Z(1)) + beta_2 * Z(2) +â€¦beta_n ( Z(n))
	- # of days to build dataset? (90 days if possible)
